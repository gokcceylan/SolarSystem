# SolarSystem
This project depicts the solar system to showcase inheritance and encapsulation in the Java language.

I did a simple solar system model in this project. Following classes are written:
GokCismi, Gezegen, Uydu, Yildiz, GunesSistemi, Gunes, Dunya, Ay
Sky Body, Planet, Satellite, Star, SunSystem, Sun, Earth, Moon (English translation)
You don't need to worry. Messages printed on the screen and the comments are in English so everyone can understand it with ease
There is an inheritance relationship between some of these classes, some of them do not. Some instances are attributes of others.
For example, Dunya is a subclass of Gezegen. Gezegen has an array of Uydu's to represent which satellites planets have if they do.
